This is an opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge and skills in application development while exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although I don't intend to study AI at a doctoral level, I hope to acquire a strong understanding at an application level to utilize it in practical work.<br>Currently, I specialize in front-end development for the web, a field I thoroughly enjoy, but I am also keen on expanding into back-end development, whether for web applications or software. My goal is to become <strong>a versatile developer</strong>. To achieve this goal, in addition to my studies at school, I am taking online courses, especially on Udemy, to strengthen and delve deeper into the programming languages I already master.<br>Aware of the rapid evolution of the technology sector, I wish to broaden my skills on frameworks, libraries such as <strong>Spring Boot, React, Angular</strong>, as well as on languages like <strong>JavaScript and PHP</strong>. I also want to dive further into application development and continue learning to constantly improve myself.",

		"CONTENT1": "- <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>: <strong>This is my most used IDE</strong>, used to program Python, C, HTML, CSS, JS and React JS, Angular. It has many extensions and interface features that I really like, that's why I've been using it all through high school until now.<br>- <strong>Eclipse</strong> The IDE I use to program Java and C++. It's a great place with commands available to create various packages, interfaces or generate functions. <strong>My #1 choice when working with traditional Java.</strong><br>- <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong>: <strong>My #1 choice when working with Java Spring Boot</strong>. Intellij supports a number of dependencies that Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite don't support.<br>- <strong>PHPStorm</strong>: <strong>The IDE I use to program PHP.</strong> It has Laravel framework, Symfony, etc. And I used it to make Dolibarr (function and class).<br>- <strong>Spring Tool Suite, Dev C++, Notepad++</strong>: The IDEs I don't use often because in my opinion they are not as convenient as the IDEs I listed.",
		"CONTENT2": "- <strong>Spring Boot</strong>: <strong>This is where I work the most with APIs</strong>. I used the API to manage data lists (you can see in my Spring Boot projects to know more).<br>- <strong>PHP</strong>: I learned to work with PHP API during my internship (or <strong>specifically PHP Dolibarr</strong>). I have to create triggers regarding API to manage orders, invoices and emails (very fun).<br>- <strong>JavaScript</strong>: I used <strong>Express JS</strong> to retrieve data in form, reformulate it and send it by nodemailer.<br>- <strong>Python</strong>: I used API to get data from data API (for example: API of bike stations of a company in all cities to process data).",

I often create databases related to projects that need back-end information, or just databases to practice writing SQL queries.<br>- <strong>PHPMyAdmin</strong>: I used PHPMyAdmin when I discovered data binding between the front and backend (when I ran the programs with xamp or wamp), the basis for my later use of Workbench.<br>- <strong>Access</strong>: The first time I came into contact with SQL. Even though it was Jet SQL, Access taught me how to establish relationships between tables, write queries and create forms.",
